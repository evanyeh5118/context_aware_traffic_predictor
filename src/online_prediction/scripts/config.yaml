# UDP CSV Data Relay System - Configuration File

# Network Configuration
relay:
  ip: 127.0.0.1
  port: 5000

# Replay Settings
replay:
  real_timing: 1  # 0 = send as fast as possible, 1 = respect original timing
  time_scale: 1.0  # Multiplier for replay speed (e.g., 2.0 = 2x faster, 0.5 = half speed)
